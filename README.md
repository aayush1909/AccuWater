ABOUT US -

Hi Guys! We are team Data Sniffers, a group of grad Data Science students from UW, and the challenge we’ve taken up is “To bloom or not to bloom”. Here we attempt to figure out how to predict algal blooms to prevent harm to both animal and human life. 
 
So we have a question for you? How many of you guys already have or are planning to get a dog? Unfortunately, back in August this year, several dog owners lost their beloved pets to algal poisoning. Let me ask you guys another question. How many of you like to go for hikes or for a swim? Lots of people don’t think about this, but lakes have algal bloom, a lot of ponds have algal bloom and other stagnant water bodies often containing toxic microcystin which imposes a life threat to humans and pets.  
 

Our solution: AccuWater! Just like checking AccuWeather for rain/precipitation updates, users can now check if it’s safe to take their pets to the lake! Our aim is to arm common people with information necessary to save themselves from algal poisoning. Our mission is Bringing Infrared data from MODIS satellites onto people’s fingertips! Though our scope is currently local, we aim to scale this up globally. 
 
We have built a demo of an application which predicts water safety and algal bloom using machine learning techniques on NASA data with ~90% accuracy. Through a simple interface, we provide users data at a glance. You can see the colour coded safety score, along with some of the key parameters we identified such as water temp and turbidity. Some other components can be identified here.
 
Using machine learning, we predicted data for future days, and have colour coded our safety scale. The safety score would be a one number summary based on each parameter.
 
From tourists to pet owners, we all need some AccuWater in our lives. Stay safe people!
